### New York Times API key

NY Times-Compose  uses the [Top Stories API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/top-stories-product/1/overview) from [New York Times](https://developer.nytimes.com/) to load stories on home screen. To use the API, you will need to obtain a free developer API key. See the
[New York Times API Documentation](https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started) for instructions.

Once you obtain the api key create a file *apikey.properties* in the root folder and add this line

```
API_KEY=<your api key>
```
